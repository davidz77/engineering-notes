### Actual Questions and Answers:

1 hour technical zoom (phone?) screen - C coding
3 final interviews
	2 technical interviews
	1 behavioral interview
3 - 4 weeks of interviews (roughly if I get another interview)

### Reflections:

I really need to prepare better.
Be more concise. I think I keep talking too long. I need to have a rough idea of what I want to talk about and then talk as little as possible. 
Take deep breaths, and just be calm. This isn't supposed to be an interrogation. 
Take a few seconds to think about what I want to talk about. It should be 1 sentence and then go on and give a few details. 

### Things to do next time:
Take a deep breath before answering. 
Summarize in one/two sentences. 
Less rambling, more concise responses
More preparation needed. Walk through possible questions beforehand and figure out what I want to talk abt. 

### Rating:
6/10
